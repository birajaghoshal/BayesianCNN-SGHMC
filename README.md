# A Bayesian framework for Convolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

This project we formulate a Bayesian framework for Convolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo(SGHMC)

Abstract:

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's) are powerful image processing models that have no estimates of uncertainty. \citep{Gal} developed efficient estimation of CNN's weight uncertainty using variational approximation. Although this method is promising, variational approximation is known to underestimate the true distribution and does not fit well on multi-modal distributions \cite{ygal}. The purpose of this study is to explore better inference methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, to better approximate model posterior of Convolutional Neural Networks architectures and improve class label prediction.
